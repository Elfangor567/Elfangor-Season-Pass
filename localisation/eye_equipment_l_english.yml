Their design was unique, refusing to use the specified 75mm L/70 gun, instead using a modified one of their own design, the 75mm A18 L/55. The gun could fire 15 rounds a minute and had hydraulics, but with less penetration. The design would be shot down because Škoda was not supposed to be in the competition. Hungary and Romania showed interest in license-production, but Germany preferred their "allies" to buy tanks directly from them."
