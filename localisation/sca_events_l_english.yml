The crowd broke through the police barricade and trashed the residence. By the time that back-up had arrived, Christian X was already dead, apparently from a sharp blow to the head. The rest of the royal family was also found dead from various injuries sustained, although there are unsubstantiated rumours that his granddaughter, Princess Elisabeth, was smuggled out safely."
