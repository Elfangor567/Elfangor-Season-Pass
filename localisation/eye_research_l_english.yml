    SWI_red_cross_tech_desc:0 "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is one of the world's largest and most prestigious organizations. This organization dedicates itself to treating the wounded of battle, and ensuring the humane treatment of those kept in POW camps. The ICRC is based in Switzerland, and even has a similar flag theme to its host nation. The government and military of Switzerland have benefited greatly from having such an organization on hand."
