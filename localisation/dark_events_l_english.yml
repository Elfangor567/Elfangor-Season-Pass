Our rebellion however consists of a rag-tag group of disaffected and a few foreign volunteers. If we wish to challenge the government, we will need to consolidate our forces and rally around a single figure. The question is, who should that figure be? We could likely invite the support of the famous Communist Marcus Garvey. Alternatively, Barduway-Jallah, the last King of the Nien dynasty of the Krahn has offered his services."

Now, Barclay stands virtually unapposed for re-election, with only former President King's Unit Whigs showing any opposition whatsoever. It is not unusual for us to meddle in elections, former President King himself held an election so fraudulent that even other countries called him out on it. We cannot be quite that blatant, but can we really risk an opposition party gaining any traction?"

Former President King has won a surprise victory, marshalling last minute support with a whirlwind campaign. Although King was himself once a True Whig, this marks the first time that the True Whigs have been out of power since 1878.

 DARK_lib.13.desc5:0 "The election yesterday shocked the elite of the nation to the core as the people of the hinterlands won a surprising victory when one of their own was elected to the highest office in the land. Sentiments in the country had certainly been swinging away from the coasts and towards the hinterlands as more and more people began arguing for greater hinterland representation, sparked by fiery speeches given by local chiefs and supportive pastors, but the government had assumed that it would never catch on among eligible voters.

Blindly we ignored these, and now former President King has managed to wrangle up enough discontents to pose a political threat. We could admit that the reign of True Whigs running unopposed has come to an end, and attempt to form a coalition government with King.
