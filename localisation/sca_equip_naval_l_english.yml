 DEN_submarine_2:0 "Havmanden Class"
 DEN_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Havmanden class consisted of five planned submarines. Three were completed before the German occupation, one was completed during the occupation, and the fifth was cancelled. The subs were fairly small, displacing 320 tons. They were armed with five 450mm torpedo tubes."

 DEN_battleship_1_desc:0 "The largest coastal defence ship built by the Danish navy prior to WWII. The Niels Iuel displaced 3,400 tons and had heavy armament for having been been launched in 1918. The Niels Iuel would be scuttled by the Danish Navy in 1943 in an attempt to prevent the Germans from seizing it. This turned out to be in vain as the Germans salvaged the ship and renamed it the 'Nordland'. The ship would finally be sunk for good in 1945 in an allied air raid. This ship is generally considered to be a pre-dreadnought battleship for classication purposes and was well-designed for its intended role."
