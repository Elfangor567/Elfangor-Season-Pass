 LIB_alone:0 "Cut Foreign Ties"
 LIB_alone_desc:0 "For too long Liberia has been taken advantage of by the imperial powers of the United Kingdom and France. The United States, our supposed "big brother" has only granted us the merest of protections, and when their predatory companies arrive, they do naught to dissuade their abuses. No more, from now on Liberia goes alone, regardless of the consequences!"
 LIB_leave_league:0 "Leave the League of Nations"
 LIB_leave_league_desc:0 "The League of Nations has only served as an extension of the will of Europe! They have had the audacity to demand that we give up our sovereignty for trumped up charges against our leaders!

 LIB_rightful_rulers:0 "RIghtful Rulers of Africa"
 LIB_rightful_rulers_desc:0 "It is no secret that Germany has a problem in Africa, not least that their... less than tolerant policies have turned possible supporters into ardent enemies.

 LIB_workers_revolution_desc:0 "A new dawn has risen over Africa! As the light of the old world dies away in the flames of yet another European war, the people of Africa suffer.

 LIB_foreign_training:0 "Foreign Officer Training"
 LIB_foreign_training_desc:0 "Although our military stands proud and ready for combat, it still pales in comparison to much of the rest of the civilized world. Our allies have armies envied around the globe, and we should learn all we can from them."

 LIB_ind_port:0 "A True Port"
 LIB_ind_port_desc:0 "The port in Monrovia barely begs the name. So rocky and treacherous most boats refuse to land, anchoring offshore and taking smaller boats to the shore. It is high-time that we built a real port in Liberia."
 LIB_ind_nav_doc:0 "Develop Naval Doctrine"
 LIB_ind_nav_doc_desc:0 "Now that we have the capacity for a navy, we need to consider what the navy will actually do beyond the very basics. Shoot the other guy does not a strategy make."
 LIB_marines_focus:0 "River, Jungle and Ocean"
 LIB_marines_focus_desc:0 "Liberia does not have the most immediately hospitable climate in the world. Our soldiers must learn to survive high heat, jungles, and rivers. We should encourage the best of those soldiers and create a special task force for them to train and serve in."

 LIB_ind_war_studies_desc:0 "If our new military is to be successful, ou officers must become versed in the ways of war. We shall ensure that our officers study all of the classics as well as the lessons learned from the more recent wars."

 LIB_us_mil_coop:0 "US Military Cooperation"
 LIB_us_mil_coop_desc:0 "Our Frontier Force has become a caricature of corruption and incompetence. No-one trusts them and we cannot rely on them for protection. The US has offered us some of their officers from their Colored Troop regiments in order to train our soldiers and teach our officers. "

 LIB_air_nav_desc:0 "As we close our relationship with the United States, our interests have become more and more intertwined. Our country's lack of airfields or bases has caught the attention of the US, who recognize our strategic importance. They have offered to build air bases and airfields in our country in exchange for their free use of said airfields. We have no reason to not accept these free buildings."
 LIB_us_training:0 "American Training Methods"
 LIB_us_training_desc:0 "As we continue to retrain our military, we have found that our old training methods were not only inadequate, but next to useless. Luckily we have American officers to show us how to properly train a soldier."

 LIB_fix_militia:0 "Update the Militia"
 LIB_fix_militia_desc:0 "Based upon the original American militias such as the "Minutemen", Liberian militias stand ready to fight should our country ever come under attack. At least they should.

 LIB_areas_defense_desc:0 "As the war progresses, we only grow closer to the United States, both financially and militarily.

We cannot turn down such expensive projects when offered at no cost! Especially not to such a close ally."
 LIB_expand_gold:0 "Expand the Gold and Diamond Mines"
 LIB_expand_gold_desc:0 "All that glitters is not gold sometimes it's diamonds. We have been mining both since the 1800's, but we have lacked the technology and financial means to truly tap into these resources. It's time that we finally began to make a move."

 LIB_port:0 "Port Agreement"
 LIB_port_desc:0 "Liberia has long suffered from not having a proper port. Many companies have expressed interest in our country only to turn away from our rocky and treacherous shores that lack any way for their ships to safely dock. The US has gracefully offered to build us a large and modern port. The proceeds of the port will go to the US until the building cost has been repaid, but this is a tiny price to pay for such an extravagant building project!"
 LIB_navy:0 "Liberian Naval Thought"
 LIB_navy_desc:0 "Outside of a few dinghy's not even big enough to deserve the term "boat" Liberia has lacked any sort of naval presence, relying entirely on the US for protection from the seas. Now that we have begun to modernize and the US has begun to build us a real port, we can finally begin to think about how to defend the coastline ourselves."
 LIB_nav_tech:0 "Naval Technologies"

 LIB_auto_tech:0 "Import Automobiles"
 LIB_auto_tech_desc:0 "Cars, trucks and other automobiles are relatively new to Liberia. We have fallen behind their use not only in the transportation industry, but in the war-fighting industry as well! We need to import foreign vehicles so that we can begin producing our own."
 LIB_armor_tech:0 "Great Tractors"
 LIB_armor_tech_desc:0 "We were not impressed when we first heard of the Great Tractors in Europe, until we realized that they were death on treads. Now we realize that we must study them, so that we can fight them, and perhaps someday make some of our own!"
 LIB_special_forces:0 "Elite Forces"
 LIB_special_forces_desc:0 "Up until now, our idea of elite troops were the non-corrupt Frontier Force soldiers. Now that we have paid and disciplined soldiers, we can begin the process of establishing specialized forces made up of the best of the best."
 LIB_jungle_training:0 "The Advantages of Africa"
 LIB_jungle_training_desc:0 "Although our location in Africa has caused our country many problems, from an isolated position to difficulty building settlements. However, our military training has caused us to realize that there are advantages to our location. Our troops are prepared for environments that most troops from Europe or America are unprepared for. We should capitalize on this advantage, for it is one of the few we have."
 LIB_greenback:0 "Complete Switch to Greenback"
 LIB_greenback_desc:0 "Starting last year our country has begun the process of switching out the pound for the US dollar. We do still produce some of our own currency, but this way we have an internationally accepted currency that does not hail from an imperialist power who wished our country gone."

 ETH_gas_reform_desc:0 "For all of our attempts at modernization, we were not ready for a modern war. The enemy has unleashed upon us the most heinous of devices of modern warfare, mustard gas! As they rule the skies the Italians continually bomb our soldiers as they run for cover and gas us whenever they fear our victory. There are techniques for lessening the impact of these attacks, we just have to make sure that our whole army learns these lessons. Preferably before we are overrun."

Ethiopia will be reborn!"

Although we have constructed defences to the south of Dagghabur, our own "Maginot Line", there is nothing stopping our enemies from simply going around it.

 ETH_new_techniques:0 "Modern Strategems"
 ETH_new_techniques_desc:0 "The old ways have had their time. We can no longer rely on simply rushing the enemy with our men in order to win. As our weapons become more sophisticated we must take care to ensure that our tactics do not fall behind, regardless of the honour of those tactics."
 ETH_break_arms_embargo:0 "Negotiate the Arms Embargo"
 ETH_break_arms_embargo_desc:0 "When the Italians began their invasion, the British and French declared a full arms embargo, knowing full well that this would only help the Italians. They even went so far as to seize weapons that had been donated to our cause. Now we are even more poorly equipped than ever before, and if we wish to fight back, we will need to try and break this embargo by all means necessary."
 ETH_jap_support:0 "Japanese Support"
 ETH_jap_support_desc:0 "So far Japan has refused to help us even diplomatically despite our appeals to them. Their populace supports us, seeing a kinship with us in our resistance to European intrusion. Now we just need to translate that into official support."
 ETH_ger_support:0 "German Support"
 ETH_ger_support_desc:0 "Of all the countries in Europe, it was the Germans who sent us supplies. Not the democracies, not the protectors of liberalism, not the revolutionaries, but the Nazis. We owe them much, and had it not been for French interference we would have a small mountain of German rifles. We should see if this support still rings true."
 ETH_fra_support:0 "French Support"
 ETH_fra_support_desc:0 "The French speak a good game, but when push came to shove they did nothing to stop the Italian invasion. They even seized shipments of weapons destined for our country due to the arms embargo, depriving us of much needed supplies. Perhaps this could be re-negotiated?"
 ETH_eng_support:0 "British Support"

 ETH_ignore_lon:0 "Nationalism"

 ETH_close_to_ger:0 "Draw Closer to Germany"
 ETH_close_to_ger_desc:0 "Germany has shown that they will go the the extra mile for any country that they support. This is more than we can say for the so-called keepers of peace in France or the United Kingdom. We know who our supporters are, we go with the Germans!"
 ETH_close_fra:0 "Improve French Relations"

 ETH_befriend_eng:0 "Befriend the Empire"
 ETH_befriend_eng_desc:0 "We may not trust Britain, and quite frankly we probably shouldn't. Although many of their citizens supported our cause, the government could not imagine backing us Africans over our European attackers. Still, they border our country and pose an immediate threat. We must make nice or die."
 ETH_follow_jap:0 "Follow the Japanese Example"
 ETH_follow_jap_desc:0 "The events of the war have only proven the thoughts of Herouy Wolde Selassie and the other 'Young Japanisers' correct. The West fears a Japan of Africa, as they should. We rise with the sun, in the model of Japan."
 ETH_leave_lon:0 "Leave the League of Nations"
 ETH_leave_lon_desc:0 "Enough of the hypocrisy, enough of the inaction. The League works only for the powerful countries and does nothing for those who need it. It has become clear that the model of internationalism is fundamentally broken. We must speak for ourselves, because no-one else will."
 ETH_re_invite_foreign_missions:0 "Re-Invite Foreign Missions"

 ETH_fra_roads:0 "Expand the Djibouti Rail Lines"
 ETH_fra_roads_desc:0 "Our rail lines are rather... lacking. Our mountainuos country makes building tracks or roads difficult. With the help of the French, we should be able to at least make modest improvements in our rail line, perhaps creating a couple more that lead to and from Djibouti, benefiting both parties."
 ETH_improve_encryption:0 "Improve Encryption"
 ETH_improve_encryption_desc:0 "Our country has relied mainly on runners do to our lack of radio for many years, and although we have now begun acquiring radios we do still have a problem.

 ETH_more_congress:0 "Increase the Power of the Legislature"
 ETH_more_congress_desc:0 "The current constitution has the Parliament acting largely as an advisory body with little true power, with its main advantage being the ability to keep the nobles tied up in the capital as senators rather than causing trouble at home. We should push for an increase in Legislative power in order to try and force at least some control over the Emperor's whims. "
 ETH_solidify_imperial_power:0 "Solidify Imperial Power"

 ETH_swedish_quality:0 "Swedish Quality"
 ETH_swedish_quality_desc:0 "The Swedish were one of our more vocal supporters during the war, and we shall never forget that. Their weapon quality has been proven and we know that we can trust them. This is a good time to deepen our relationship with them."
 ETH_go_communist:0 "The Voice of the People"
 ETH_go_communist_desc:0 "For far too long the people of Ethiopia have been oppressed. Even as power has supposedly been granted to them, it only hides the fact that the true masters remain the same. The people work and others benefit. The time has come so that every person gains the benefit of their own labour."
 ETH_com_militias:0 "From Levies to Militias"
 ETH_com_militias_desc:0 "Every man is expected to be ready to fight for the Empire in case of attack. We can use this to our advantage by connecting people across the land and creating more formalized militias. The best part is that it will appear to be a boon for the Empire, when in fact these militias will be its death!"

 ETH_turn_evil:0 "Look Into The Darkness"
 ETH_turn_evil_desc:0 "Our closer relationship to Germany has allowed us to take a closer look into their governance and beliefs, and there is much to be admired there. We can use our German contacts to begin creating our own tracts on the ruling class."
 ETH_as_in_the_east:0 "The Eastern Dawn"
 ETH_as_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Japanese are the rightful rulers of the Far East, their actions and power speak to theat. The Germans have proven themselves the masters of Europe. But what of Africa? We are the unconquered people, the ones whom no European can match. When the New World Order comes, we will rule the continent in friendship with the Japanese and Germans. Together we will create the perfect triarchy!"

 ETH_restrict_nobles:0 "Restrict Noble Priveleges"
 ETH_restrict_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have had a stranglehold on the country for years and only in the last couple of decades have we been able to loosen their grasp. Winning the war has given us, at least temporarily, a unique opportunity. We need to use our popularity to reign in the nobles while we still can."
 ETH_abolish_slavery:0 "Abolish the Gedar System"
 ETH_abolish_slavery_desc:0 "The Gedar system is a horribly outdated idea that significantly weakens our outside influence and restricts our ability to modernize. Sure the nobles like this feudalistic system that encourages what essentally amounts to slavery, but the Italians got a lot of positive press for claiming to be coming in to abolish this system. We cannot allow another country to define the narrative in such a way ever again!"

 ETH_grab_djibuoti_desc:0 "France has fallen, and it can no longer protect it's colonies. We will never have a better chance to seize Djibouti. The garrison there is strong, but perhaps we can convince them and what remains of the French government to surrender peacefully."
 ETH_grab_somaliland:0 "Demand British Somaliland"

 ETH_coop_eng_infr_desc:0 "The British African colonies are tremendously under-developed, a fact that the British are very well aware of. But together we can try and alleviate this somewhat. Together we can expand the rail lines in both our country and in the English colonies, creating more connections and generally just increasing the local infrastructure."
 ETH_a_new_ally:0 "A New Ally"

 ETH_expand_the_army_desc:0 "We may have access to a large number of troops, but most of those are the personal troops of the Rases, not the Imperial Army which is rather small comparitively.

 ETH_ras_cooperation:0 "Cooperate With the Rases"
 ETH_ras_cooperation_desc:0 "We cannot go this alone, we need the help of select Rases in order to bring the rest of the country to heel. It may mean making some concessions, but it's better than failing due to lack of support."
 ETH_shun_rases:0 "[ETH_imperial_or_communist2]"
 ETH_shun_rases_desc:0 "We cannot trust the Rases with any power whatsever, they have proven themselves fickle allies at best. A couple will be trusted, but by and large we should focus on the Imperial Troops, not those of the Rases."
 ETH_air_force:0 "Air Force Investment"
 ETH_air_force_desc:0 "Our air force barely deserves the name. A few planes gifted to us from those sympathetic to our cause does not exactly strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. The Italians have shown us the horrors of Air Supremacy, and we should not forgot those lessons."
 ETH_buy_planes:0 "Plane Purchases"
 ETH_buy_planes_desc:0 "We can only build planes so quickly when we have so little industry. We must look to see if any countries are willing to sell us their overstock. Even out-of-date models will allow us to build up a fleet and give our would-be pilots experience in the air."
 ETH_coastal_defence_tactics:0 "Coastal Defence"
 ETH_coastal_defence_tactics_desc:0 "We cannot hope to compete on the high seas. We need to focus on building ships that can reasonably defend us from invasion from close to shore, coastal defence ships. This is our future."

 ETH_air_navy_coop:0 "Navy and Air Force Cooperation"
 ETH_air_navy_coop_desc:0 "Our navy and air force are very new compared to the established army. We should take this opportunity to make sure that these to branches work with one another rather than against. We admire Japan, but that does not mean that we want to be a carbon copy!"

 ETH_carrier_focus_desc:0 "We may be a bit far away from being able to produce our own carriers, but the sooner we study the tech, the better!"
 ETH_float_planes:0 "Naval Planes"
 ETH_float_planes_desc:0 "Further studies of Air and Naval cooperation has shown us the importance of naval planes. Bombers that can take out enemy ships, fighters that defend these bombers. Variations of both that can fit on and be launched from a ship. These are all things that we should be looking into."
 ETH_wolfpacks:0 "Wolfpacks"
 ETH_wolfpacks_desc:0 "Submarines are extremely useful. They are cheap, easy to cosntruct and can wreck havic on an unprepared enemy. We should make use of these versatile weapons."

 ETH_flagship:0 "The Imperial Flagship"
 ETH_flagship_desc:0 "What is a navy without a flagship? We have expanded our dockyards and begun building ourselves a fleet, but it needs something special. We need a large ship that truly epitomizes the grace of the Empire and the Emperor."

 ETH_light_plane_focus:0 "Local Air Defence Focus"

 ETH_heavy_plane_focus:0 "An Air Force Abroad"
 ETH_heavy_plane_focus_desc:0 "We will not be fighting over own skies so much as we will in far away lands. If we wish to reach these places, we must focus on planes that can make those kinds of trips."
 ETH_integrate_eritrea:0 "Eritrean Integration"
 ETH_integrate_eritrea_desc:0 "We have finally reclaimed the lost province of Eritrea! We need to re-integrate these people back into our empire as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there are those who would stand in our way, the so-called Eritrean nationalists who foolishly believe that Eritrea's destiny differs from the Empires. Perhaps we could assuage some of their members by grantingt the province greater autonomy, for now."
 ETH_crush_eritrea:0 "Crush Eritrean Nationalism"
 ETH_crush_eritrea_desc:0 "The Eritreans have proven to be slippery and traitorous. Already there are those within the province that demand self-government! This kind of anti-imperial sentiment cannot be tolerated!"
 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet:0 "A Land for the Somalis"
 ETH_establish_somalian_puppet_desc:0 "The various Somali peoples in our lands have long not exactly been the most stable subjects. However, this largely stems from the lack of a coutnry they can truly call their own that isn't ours. With our control of Somalia, we can change that. We will create a highly autonomous puppet state under the governership of a loyal Somali. This will hopefully quell much of the Somali unrest in our country."
 ETH_order_in_somalia:0 "Force Somalian Integration"
 ETH_order_in_somalia_desc:0 "The Somalians in our country have long resisted and resented our rule. They simply refuse to follow the rules of the empire. For too long we have been unable to punish this behavior, but times have changed. They will obey our rule, or else."
 ETH_another_light:0 "Another Light Against The Darkness"
 ETH_another_light_desc:0 "Germany's expansion has gone from worrying to downright terrifying. We must stand up to this egregious breach of international trust. We must not allow another country to be invaded as we were, and we will not stop at mere finger-pointing!"
 ETH_join_japan:0 "African-Asian Prosperity"
 ETH_join_japan_desc:0 "Our future lies with the east. There is simply too much baggage in Europe for us to tie ourselves too closely to any European country. We will work on collaberating with the Japanese."
 ETH_own_way:0 "Tilt the Axis"
 ETH_own_way_desc:0 "Germany has only increased their support for our country. This marks an excellent opportunity for us to truly ingratiate ourselves with them. The rest of the world will tremble when we join hand in hand with the Germans."
 ETH_stand_against_expansionism:0 "Stand Against Expansionism"

 ETH_elecronic_focus:0 "Electronic Focus"
 ETH_elecronic_focus_desc:0 "Elctricity and electronics in general are severely lacking in our country. We should begin to put serious thought into creating an electrical framework. In addition, we really need to get our hands on military-grade electronics. They will doubtless be of extreme importance in the future, and we do not wish to be left behind."
 ETH_modern_weapons:0 "Weapons for the Modern Age"
 ETH_modern_weapons_desc:0 "The importance of modern weaponry may be somewhat overstated at times, we ourselves have proven this multiple time. But we still cannot pretend that they are very helpful. Our country relies far too heavily on pre-established weaponry, much of it pre-1900. The time has definitely come for an upgrade. Several upgrades actually."
 ETH_trucks:0 "Capacity for Mechanized Units"
 ETH_trucks_desc:0 "Our country has only recently been getting involved with automobiles. Our country is largely not conducive to them, but with changing technologies this has become less and less of an excuse. We need to start preparing ourselves for the future of warfare, or else find ourselves run over by it."
 ETH_motor_infr:0 "Road Construction"
 ETH_motor_infr_desc:0 "One of the major issues our country faces is a serious lack of roads, especially paved ones. Granted, mountain roads are hard to make and mantain, but we must do so if we wish to connect our country and join the modern world."
 ETH_tank_focus:0 "Our Own Armor"
 ETH_tank_focus_desc:0 "The Italians used armour against us in the war, and we proved that it was not as great as advertised, at least in the north. The south however tells us a different story, armour in a flat setting can be absolutely devastating, and we need to create some of our own as soon as possible!"
 ETH_arty_focus:0 "Modern Artillery"
 ETH_arty_focus_desc:0 "Our artillery is, in many cases, laughable. We still have cannons, actual cannons, in our arsenal. This is unacceptable for a modern army. Work must be done in order to rectify this problem."
 ETH_anti_tank_focus:0 "Anti-Tank Preparedness"
 ETH_anti_tank_focus_desc:0 "Our country wimply does not have the resources to participate in the armour race. We should instead focus on how to counteract the presence of armour. If we cannot join them, then shoot them dead."

 ETH_oletta_school:0 "Expand the Oletta School"
 ETH_oletta_school_desc:0 "The Oletta Cadet School has finally had its first graduates, and we can proudly state that the experiment has been a success.
