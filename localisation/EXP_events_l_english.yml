 EXP_events.1.t:0 "Monarchists Demand Referendum"
 EXP_events.1.desc:0 "It appears that monarchism is a far stronger force than many had given it credit for. Support for a monarch in our country has grown at an alarming rate, and it is now believed that more than half of our country's population supports the monarchy. Buoyed by their popularity, the monarchists have demnanded that we hold a referendum as soon as possible. The [Root.GetRulingParty] maintains that we simply cannot turn back the clock and return to such an old-fashioned form of government. However, the popularity of monarchism cannot be denied, and should the referendum be rejected, there is no telling what could happen next."
 EXP_events.2.t:0 "Social Democrats Demand Referendum"
 EXP_events.2.desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty] argues that social democracy will only weaken the nation both internally and externally. However, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
