 ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc:0 "Coastal defence ships were warships built for the purpose of coastal defence, mostly during the period from 1860 to 1920. They were small, often cruiser-sized warships that sacrificed speed and range for armour and armament. They were usually attractive to nations that either could not afford full-sized battleships or could be satisfied by specially designed shallow-draft vessels capable of littoral operations close to their own shores. The Nordic countries and Thailand found them particularly appropriate for their island-dotted coastal waters. Some vessels had limited blue-water capabilities; others operated in rivers."

They represented very variegated company: huge, to Danish measures, Ingolf with more than 1000t displacement, armed with 120mm guns and carrying a seaplane, and small 80t Ternen with 37mm gun."
