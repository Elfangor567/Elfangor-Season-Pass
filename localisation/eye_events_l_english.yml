He was saved by his wife Hedwig, who noticing that Frankfurter was acting odd, questioned him as to why he wanted to see her husband. In a panic, Frankfurter accidentally exposed the pistol concealed in his jacket. Hedwig tackled Frankfurter and called for her husband who quickly helped her secure Frankfurter. Police were called to the scene, and Frankfurter was led away. He claims that he acted in response to the laws passed by Germany's Nazi Party last year. His trial date has yet to be set."
